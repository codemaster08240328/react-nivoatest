Ok I've got a changed spec for you (as the original task has been resolved)

Navigate to the third tab of the Chord chart of my project. It has 4 controls for margin values. The API doc for it is at https://nivo.rocks/chord (the Margin tab)

The chart itself (/chart/chord.jsx) has its sidebar component at /sidebarinstances/sidebarChord.jsx and some default settings at /value/defaultSettingsChord.jsx. The control for each margin selection can be found at 
/viewinstance/sliderMarginBottom.jsx
/viewinstance/sliderMarginLeft.jsx
/viewinstance/sliderMarginRight.jsx
/viewinstance/sliderMarginTop.jsx

So to summarise, your solution should integrate each control in the Chord chart sidebar, so that toggling the slider will increase/decrease margin amount for the relevant position
